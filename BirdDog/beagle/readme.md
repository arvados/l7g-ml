h2. The following is a short explanation of this directory and the subdirectories

Essentially, when we moved on from testing out Eagle to testing out Beagle, it got its own directory. But when efforts were made to combine Eagle and Beagle into one
pipeline, they were basically put in the same directory as Beagle.

h3. example

Beagle comes with a prepackaged example that you can run. If you don't have all the files necessary for the example, Beagle will even download them for you.

h3. map

Beagle requires genetic map files. They're located here.

h3. scripts

This is where the real work happens. All scripts for testing, as well as eventual components of the pipelines are here.
